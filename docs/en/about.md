# About me

Hi!
I understand that the page looks unusual, but sometimes I climb where I shouldn't in order to do something original.
My name is Denis, I studied not in my specialty and my path lay through the first line of Rostelecom, but here I am, from scratch, achieving the position of network administrator
and I am writing this text. I figured out the stack of the vacancy from scratch, I will note that I made the commenting through example, and not #, I thought it would be more professional.
I understand that writing an additional page with my biography in the text was not, but I wanted to leave something about myself in this stream of monotonous works from other candidates.
