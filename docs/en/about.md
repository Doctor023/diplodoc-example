# A little about myself

Hi! Yes, the page looks unusual - sometimes I go where I shouldn't, just to do something interesting.

My name is Denis. I came to IT not through a classical education, but through the first line of support at Rostelecom. But thanks to persistence and self-study, I grew from scratch to a network administrator - and here I am.

In this task, I figured out the required stack from scratch. For example, for commenting, I used example instead of # - I decided that it would be more correct.

Yes, there was no separate page with a biography in the technical task, but I wanted to leave something personal among the monotonous work of other candidates.
